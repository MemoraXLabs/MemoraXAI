# MemoraX

**The memory layer for long-horizon intelligence**

MemoraX is not a product, an agent, or a model.  
It is the layer that allows intelligent systems to persist across time.

Modern AI is episodic.  
It generates, responds, and resets.

Long-horizon intelligence requires something different:  
a layer that carries identity, context, and accumulated understanding forward between interactions.

That layer is memory.  
**MemoraX is its name.**

## What This Repository Is

This repository is the **canonical reference** for the memory layer of long-horizon intelligence.

It is not an implementation.  
It is the definition and namespace of where **continuity, identity, and persistence** live in the AI stack.

Models reason.  
Tools execute.  
**MemoraX persists.**

Every intelligent system is bounded by how far its memory can reach.  
MemoraX is the layer that extends that horizon.

## What Continuity Is Not

These distinctions are **non-negotiable**.

- **Long context is not continuity**  
  It is just a longer episode.

- **Retrieval is not identity**  
  Accessing past information does not preserve self.

- **Session memory is not persistence**  
  If restarting the system resets who it is, continuity is absent.

Storing data is not the same as preserving identity.  
History alone does not compound understanding.

## Diagnostic Question

**If the system restarts, is it still the same system?**

- If the answer is **no** → continuity is absent  
- If the answer requires explanation → continuity is weak  
- If the answer is **yes, without qualification** → continuity is present

## Specification

MemoraX defines the canonical memory layer for long-horizon intelligence.

- **Current specification:** [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) (v0.2)  
  Extended conceptual specification covering scope, lifecycle semantics, governance, and reference use cases.

- **Archived specification:** [`SPEC-v0.1.md`](./SPEC-v0.1.md)  
  Original foundational definition of identity-preserving memory primitives and core operations.

SPEC v0.1 establishes the core ontology.  
SPEC v0.2 extends it with lifecycle and governance semantics while preserving the original primitives and philosophy.
