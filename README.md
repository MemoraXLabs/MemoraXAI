# MemoraX

**The memory layer for long-horizon intelligence**

MemoraX is not a product, an agent, or a model.  
It is the layer that allows intelligent systems to persist across time.

Modern AI is episodic.  
It generates, responds, and resets.

Long-horizon intelligence requires something different:  
a layer that carries **identity**, **context**, and **accumulated understanding** forward between interactions.

That layer is memory.  
**MemoraX is its name.**

## What this repository is

### Specification
Current draft: [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) (v0.1 – primitives, operations & core concepts)

This repository is the canonical reference for the memory layer of long-horizon intelligence.

It is not an implementation.  
It is the definition and namespace of where continuity, identity, and persistence live in the AI stack.

**Models reason.**  
**Tools execute.**  
**MemoraX persists.**

Every intelligent system is bounded by how far its memory can reach.  
MemoraX is the layer that extends that horizon.
